As a result, it includes some particular requirements for medical devices and excludes some of the requirements of ISO 9001 that are not appropriate as regulatory requirements. Because of these exclusions, organizations whose quality management systems conform to this International Standard cannot claim conformity to ISO 9001 unless their quality management systems conform to all the requirements of ISO 9001.\nAll requirements of ISO 13485:2003 are specific to organizations providing medical devices, regardless of the type or size of the organization.\nIf regulatory requirements permit exclusions of design and development controls, this can be used as a justification for their exclusion from the quality management system. These regulations can provide alternative arrangements that are to be addressed in the quality management system. It is the responsibility of the organization to ensure that claims of conformity with ISO 13485:2003 reflect exclusion of design and development controls.\nIf any requirement(s) in Clause 7 of ISO 13485:2003 is(are) not applicable due to the nature of the medical device(s) for which the quality management system is applied, the organization does not need to include such a requirement(s) in its quality management system.\nThe processes required by ISO 13485:2003, which are applicable to the medical device(s), but which are not performed by the organization, are the responsibility of the organization and are accounted for in the organization's quality management system.",

It strengthens links to ISO 14971:2007 and the related methods of risk management as applied to safety related aspects of medical device user interfaces. Part 2 contains tutorial information to assist manufactures in complying with Part 1, as well as offering more detailed descriptions of usability engineering methods that can be applied more generally to medical devices that go beyond safety-related aspects of medical device user interfaces.",

All relevant requirements in IEC 80001-1:2010 are addressed and links to other clauses and subclauses of IEC 80001-1 are addressed where appropriate (e.g. handover to release management and monitoring). This technical report focuses on practical risk management. It is not intended to provide a full outline or explanation of all requirements that are satisfactorily covered by IEC 80001-1. This step-by-step guidance follows a 10-step process that follows subclause 4.4 of IEC 80001-1:2010, which specifically addresses risk analysis, risk evaluation and risk control. These activities are embedded within the full life cycle risk management process.

Use of this part of 80001 is intended to be one of the possible means to bridge the gap between MDMs and HDOs in providing adequate information to support the HDOs risk management of IT-networks. This document leverages the requirements set out in ISO/IEC 15026-2 for the development of assurance cases. It is not intended that this security case framework will replace a risk management strategy, rather, the intention is to complement risk management and in turn provide a greater level of assurance for a medical device by:\n- mapping specific risk management steps to each of the IEC TR 80001-2-2 security capabilities, identifying associated threats and vulnerabilities and presenting them in the format of a security case with the inclusion of a re-useable security pattern;\n- providing guidance for the selection of appropriate security controls to establish security capabilities and presenting them as part of the security case pattern (IEC TR 80001-2-8 provides examples of such security controls);\n- providing evidence to support the implementation of a security control, hence providing confidence in the establishment of each of the security capabilities.\nThe purpose of developing the security case is to demonstrate confidence in the establishment of IEC TR 80001-2-2 security capabilities. The quality of artifacts gathered and documented during the development of the security case is agreed and documented as part of a responsibility agreement between the relevant stakeholders.

            "abstract": "IEC TR 80002-3:2014 which is a technical report (TR), provides the description of software life cycle processes for medical devices. The medical device software life cycle processes are derived from IEC 62304:2006, with corresponding safety classes. They have been aligned with the software development life cycle processes of ISO/IEC 12207:2008 and are presented herein in full compliance with ISO/IEC 24774:2010. The content of these three standards provides the foundation of this TR. This TR does not:           - address areas already covered by existing related standards, e.g. the international standards that relate to the four standards used to build this TR (see Bibliography);                    \n- FDA guidance documents; or                            \n- software development tools. This TR describes the process reference model for medical device software development and is limited in scope to the life cycle processes described in IEC 62304:2006. The process names correspond to those of IEC 62304:2006. The mappings provided in Annex B are essential for the alignment between IEC 62304:2006 (which is based on ISO/IEC 12207:1995) and ISO/IEC 12207:2008, developed to address the detailed normative relationship between the two standards. This technical report is not intended to be used as the basis of regulatory inspection or certification assessment activities.",
