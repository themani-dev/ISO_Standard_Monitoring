The primary objective of ISO 13485:2003 is to facilitate harmonized medical device regulatory requirements for quality management systems. As a result, it includes some particular requirements for medical devices and excludes some of the requirements of ISO 9001 that are not appropriate as regulatory requirements. Because of these exclusions, organizations whose quality management systems conform to this International Standard cannot claim conformity to ISO 9001 unless their quality management systems conform to all the requirements of ISO 9001.
All requirements of ISO 13485:2003 are specific to organizations providing medical devices, regardless of the type or size of the organization.
If regulatory requirements permit exclusions of design and development controls, this can be used as a justification for their exclusion from the quality management system. These regulations can provide alternative arrangements that are to be addressed in the quality management system. It is the responsibility of the organization to ensure that claims of conformity with ISO 13485:2003 reflect exclusion of design and development controls.
If any requirement(s) in Clause 7 of ISO 13485:2003 is(are) not applicable due to the nature of the medical device(s) for which the quality management system is applied, the organization does not need to include such a requirement(s) in its quality management system.

The information may be required on the device itself, as part of the label, or provided with the device.

The symbols specified in ISO 3826-2:2008 do not replace current national regulatory requirements.
Manufacturers seek to take costs out of labelling by reducing or rationalizing variants. This results in a major problem of translation, design and logistics when multiple languages are included on a single label or piece of documentation. As other medical devices, blood medical devices, labelled in a number of different languages, can experience confusion and delay in locating the appropriate language. ISO 3826-2:2008 proposes solutions to these problems through the use of internationally recognized symbols with precisely defined meanings.
ISO 3826-2:2008 is primarily intended to be used by manufacturers of medical devices dedicated to the blood collection, process storage and distribution, who market identical products in countries having different language requirements for medical device labelling.

It can be considered as a supplement to ISO 14630:2012, which specifies general requirements for the performance of non-active surgical implants.
NOTE          Due to the variations in the design of implants covered by ISO 7198 :2016 and, in some cases, due to the relatively recent development of some of these implants (e.g. bioabsorbable vascular prostheses, cell based tissue engineered vascular prostheses), acceptable standardized in vitro tests and clinical results are not always available. As further scientific and clinical data become available, appropriate revision of ISO 7198 :2016 will be necessary.
It is applicable to sterile tubular vascular grafts implanted by direct visualization surgical techniques as opposed to fluoroscopic or other non-direct imaging (e.g. computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), intended to replace, bypass, or form shunts between segments of the vascular system in humans and vascular patches intended for repair and reconstruction of the vascular system.

While vascular prostheses that are made wholly or partly of materials of non-viable biological origin, including tissue engineered vascular prostheses are within the scope, ISO 7198:2016 does not address sourcing, harvesting, manufacturing and all testing requirements for biological materials. It is further noted that different regulatory requirements might exist for tissues from human and animal sources.
Compound, coated, composite, and externally reinforced vascular prostheses are within the scope of ISO 7198:2016.

VDDCPs are medical devices with various clinical indications for use in the human vascular blood system. A VDDCP incorporates, as an integral part, substance(s) which, if used separately, can be considered to be a medicinal substance or product (drug substance, drug product) but the action of the medicinal substance is ancillary to that of the device and supports the primary mode of action (PMOA) of the device. With regard to safety, this part of ISO 12417 outlines requirements for intended performance, design attributes, materials, design evaluation, manufacturing, sterilization, packaging, and information supplied by the manufacturer. For implanted products, this International Standard should be considered as a supplement to ISO 14630, which specifies general requirements for the performance of non-active surgical implants. This International Standard should also be considered as a supplement to relevant device-specific standards, such as the ISO 25539‑series specifying requirements for endovascular devices. Requirements listed in this part of ISO 12417 also address VDDCPs that are not permanent implants.
NOTE          Due to variations in the design of combination products covered by this part of ISO 12417 and due to the relatively recent development of some of these combination products, acceptable standardized in vitro test results and clinical study results are not always available. As further scientific and clinical data become available, appropriate revision of this part of ISO 12417 might be necessary.
Delivery systems or parts of the delivery system are included in the scope of this part of ISO 12417, if they comprise an integral component of the vascular device and if they are drug-covered (e.g. drug-covered balloon catheters and drug-covered guidewires).
Devices whose PMOA is to provide a conduit for delivery of a drug, are excluded from the scope of this part of ISO 12417 (e.g. infusion catheters), unless they contain a drug component that is intended to have an ancillary action to the device part (e.g. antimicrobial coated infusion catheter).
Procedures and devices used prior to and following the introduction of the VDDCP (e.g. balloon angioplasty devices) are excluded from the scope of this part of ISO 12417 if they do not affect the drug-related aspects of the device.
ISO 12417-1:2015 is not comprehensive with respect to the pharmacological evaluation of VDDCPs. Some information on the requirements of different national and regional authorities is given in Annex B.
Absorbable components of VDDCPs (e.g. coatings) are addressed by this part of ISO 12417 in their connection with drug-related aspects of the device. Degradation and other time-dependent aspects of absorbable implants and coatings are not completely addressed by this part of ISO 12417.

In order to illustrate the issues raised, an inter-laboratory power measurement study was conducted on ten different lenses measured by nine organizations worldwide. Twenty-five focimeters of different types were used. The test lenses were spherically powered allyl diglycol carbonate (ADC) hard resin lenses surfaced to -4,00 D, -2,00 D, 0,00 D, +2,00 D, and +4,00 D, each with an addition power of 2,50 D. Five were D28 bifocals and five were progressive power lenses. The measurements were front distance power, front near power, back distance power and back near power, for each lens and for each focimeter used. Each lens was measured nine times: five measurements taken without repositioning the lens and four measurements taken with the lens repositioned each time.
The assessed parameters were divided in three categories:
discrepancies due to focimeter design and measurement methods;systematic errors;random errors.
For each parameter, experimental results are given, as well as theoretical ones when needed. Measurement data include front distance portion power, front near portion power, back distance portion power and back near portion power.
Unless stated otherwise, in order to show relevant information, the results shown are for the D28 bifocals when no different behaviour was found for the progressive power lenses.",Published,2007-01,1,15,ISO/TC 172/SC 7 Ophthalmic optics and instruments,11.040.70:Ophthalmic equipment,https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#!iso:std:41182:en,,

Satisfactory validation in accordance with this document does not necessarily demonstrate inactivation of infective agents of this type. Risk controls related to sourcing, collection and handling of animal materials are described in ISO 22442-2.
NOTE 3  The validation of the inactivation, elimination, or elimination and inactivation of viruses and TSE agents is described in ISO 22442-3.
NOTE 4  Manufacturing processes for medical devices containing animal tissues frequently include exposure to chemical agents which can significantly reduce the bioburden on the medical device. Following the manufacturing process, a medical device is exposed to a specified sterilization process.
NOTE 5  Such testing is a crucial part of the design and development of a medical device.
NOTE 6  ISO 10993-17 specifies a method to establish allowable limits for residues of sterilizing agents.

Whilst recognizing that some people with very extensive and complex disabilities may have requirements beyond the level addressed in this Guide, a very large number of people have minor impairments which can be easily addressed by relatively small changes of approach in standards, thereby increasing the market for the product or service.
This Guide aims
to inform, increase understanding and raise awareness about how human abilities impact on the usability of products, services and environments,to outline the relationship between the requirements in standards and the accessibility and usability of products and services, andto raise awareness about the benefits of adopting accessible design principles in terms of a wider market.
1.2 This Guide applies to products, services and environments encountered in all aspects of daily life and intended for the consumer market and the workplace. For the purposes of this document, the term 'products and services' is used to reflect all these purposes.
1.3 This Guide
describes a process by which the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities may be considered in the development of standards,provides tables to enable standards developers to relate the relevant clauses of a standard to the factors which should be considered to ensure that all abilities are addressed,offers descriptions of body functions or human abilities and the practical implications of impairment,offers a list of sources that standards developers can use to investigate more detailed and specific guidance materials.
1.4 This Guide provides general guidance. Consideration should be given to the development of additional guides for specific product or service sectors.
1.5 While it is recognized that accessibility and usability are important for both products amd services, international work on services standards is at the preliminary stage. At present, this Guide contains considerably more guidance on products than on services.

Some abilities may not ever be present in a user as they may have been born without them. Some abilities are acquired, developed or deteriorate over time due to education, maturity, injury, illness or age. Just as it is possible that a user possesses a combination of abilities, it is also possible that they may lack a combination of abilities.
ISO/IEC TR 19765:2007 presents icons and symbols currently used to provide access to facilities and tools to support the needs of elderly and disabled users of information technology (IT) products, and could form the basis of a future International Standard which would provide a recommended collection of icons and symbols.
These icons and symbols have been collected from a variety of sources including other standards, contemporary software products, web sites and hardware devices. These sources are cross-referenced and listed in a bibliography.
The icons and symbols presented in ISO/IEC TR 19765:2007 are categorized by modality and method of use.",Withdrawn,2007-07,1,28,ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 35 User interfaces,35.020:Information technology (IT) in general|01.080.50:Graphical symbols for use on information technology and telecommunications technical drawings and in relevant technical product documentation|11.180.99:Other standards related to aids for disabled and handicapped people,,,

ISO/IEC TR 19766:2007 introduces a set of attributes and operations that can be implemented as features of graphic icons to make the functionality of these icons accessible to the widest possible range of users. Textual attributes are emphasized because they can be rendered in various alternate modalities. ISO/IEC 11581-1 provides guidance on the graphic aspects of icons.
