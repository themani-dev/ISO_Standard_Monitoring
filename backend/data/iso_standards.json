It specifies performance requirements for cleaning and disinfection as well as for the accessories which can be required to achieve the necessary performance. The methods and instrumentation required for validation, routine control and monitoring and re-validation, periodically and after essential repairs, are also specified.\nThe requirements for washer-disinfectors intended to process specific loads are specified in subsequent parts of ISO 15883. For washer-disinfectors intended to process loads of two or more different types the requirements of all relevant parts of this standard apply.\nISO 15883-1:2006 does not specify requirements intended for machines for use for laundry or general catering purposes.\nISO 15883-1:2006 does not include requirements for machines which are intended to sterilize the load, or which are designated as \"sterilizers\", these are specified in other standards e.g. EN 285.\nThe specified performance requirements of this standard may not ensure the inactivation or removal of the causative agent(s) (prion protein) of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.\nISO 15883-1:2006 may be used by prospective purchasers and manufacturers as the basis of agreement on the specification of a WD. The test methods for demonstration of compliance with the requirements of ISO 15883-1:2006 may also be employed by users to demonstrate continued compliance of the installed WD throughout its working life. Guidance on a routine test programme also is given.",
