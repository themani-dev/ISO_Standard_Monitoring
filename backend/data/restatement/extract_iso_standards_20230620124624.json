The provision of hearing aids relies on the knowledge and practices of a hearing aid professional, to ensure the proper fitting and adequate service in the interest of the client with hearing loss.\nThis document specifies general processes of HAFM from the client profile to the follow-up through administering, organising and controlling hearing aid fitting through all stages. It also specifies important preconditions such as education, facilities and systems that are required to ensure proper services.\nThe focus of this document is the services offered to the majority of adult clients with hearing impairment. It is recognized that certain populations with hearing loss such as children, persons with other disabilities or persons with implantable devices can require services outside the scope of this document. This document generally applies to air conduction hearing aids and for the most part also to bone conduction devices.\nHearing loss can be a consequence of serious medical conditions. Hearing aid professionals are not in a position to diagnose or treat such conditions. When assisting clients seeking hearing rehabilitation without prior medical examination, hearing aid professionals are expected to be observant of symptoms of such conditions and refer to proper medical care.\nFurther to the main body of the document, which specifies the HAFM requirements and processes, several informative annexes are provided. Appropriate education of hearing aid professionals is vital for exercising HAFM. Annex A defines the competencies required for the HAFM processes. Annex B offers a recommended curriculum for the education of hearing aid professionals. Annex C is an example of an appropriate fitting room. Annex D gives guidance on the referral of clients for medical or other specialist examination and treatment. Annex E is a recommendation for important information to be exchanged with the client during the process of HAFM. Annex F is a comprehensive terminology list offering definitions of the most current terms related to HAFM.\nIt is the intention that these annexes be helpful to those who wish to deliver HAFM of the highest quality.",

Procedures for the routine radiation process-ing of blood product (blood and blood components) are also given. If followed, these procedures will help ensure that blood product exposed to gamma radiation or X-radiation (bremsstrahlung) will receive absorbed doses with a speci\ufb01ed range.\n1.2 This practice covers dosimetry for the irradiation of blood product for self-contained irradiators (free-standing irradiators) utilizing radionuclides such as 137Cs and 60Co, or X-radiation (bremsstrahlung). The absorbed dose range for blood irradiation is typically 15 Gy to 50 Gy.\n1.3 The photon energy range of X-radiation used for blood irradiation is typically from 40 keV to 300 keV.\n1.4 This practice also covers the use of radiation-sensitive indicators for the visual and qualitative indication that the product has been irradiated (see ISO/ASTM Guide 51539).\n1.5 ISO 51939:2017 is one of a set of standards that provides recommendations for properly implementing dosimetry in radiation processing and describes a means of achieving compliance with the requirements of ISO/ASTM Practice 52628 for dosimetry performed for blood irradiation. It is intended to be read in conjunction with ISO/ASTM Practice 52628.\n1.6 ISO 51939:2017 does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro-priate safety and health practices and to determine the applicability or regulatory limitations prior to use.",

This document describes a proactive and systematic process that manufacturers can use to collect and analyse appropriate data, to provide information for the feedback processes and use this to meet applicable regulatory requirements to gain experience from the post-production activities. The output of this process can be used:\n\u2014     as input into product realization;\n\u2014     as input into risk management;\n\u2014     for monitoring and maintaining product requirements;\n\u2014     for communicating to regulatory authorities; or\n\u2014     as input into improvement processes.\nThis document does not address market surveillance activities to be performed by regulatory authorities. Neither does it specify a manufacturer's actions required by the applicable regulatory requirements resulting from their production or post-production activities, nor reporting to regulatory authorities. This document is not intended to replace or change applicable regulatory requirements for post-market surveillance.",

This document leverages the requirements set out in ISO/IEC 15026-2 for the development of assurance cases. It is not intended that this security case framework will replace a risk management strategy, rather, the intention is to complement risk management and in turn provide a greater level of assurance for a medical device by:\n- mapping specific risk management steps to each of the IEC TR 80001-2-2 security capabilities, identifying associated threats and vulnerabilities and presenting them in the format of a security case with the inclusion of a re-useable security pattern;\n- providing guidance for the selection of appropriate security controls to establish security capabilities and presenting them as part of the security case pattern (IEC TR 80001-2-8 provides examples of such security controls);\n- providing evidence to support the implementation of a security control, hence providing confidence in the establishment of each of the security capabilities.\nThe purpose of developing the security case is to demonstrate confidence in the establishment of IEC TR 80001-2-2 security capabilities. The quality of artifacts gathered and documented during the development of the security case is agreed and documented as part of a responsibility agreement between the relevant stakeholders.

It also includes requirements for individual devices specified for use in humidification systems such as heated breathing tubes (heated-wire breathing tubes) and devices intended to control these heated breathing tubes (heated breathing tube controllers). ISO 5367 specifies other safety and performance requirements for breathing tubes.\nNOTE Heated breathing tubes are medical electrical equipment and are subject to the requirements of IEC 60601-1. \nISO 8185:2007 also includes requirements for active HME (heat and moisture exchanger) devices, which actively add heat and moisture to increase the humidity level of the gas delivered from the HME to the patient. It is not applicable to passive HMEs, which return a portion of the patient's expired moisture and heat to the respiratory tract during inspiration without adding heat and moisture. ISO 9360-1 and ISO 9360-2 specify safety and performance requirements for passive HMEs and describe methods for testing performance. \nRespiratory tract humidifiers can be gas-powered, electrically-powered, or both. However, ISO 8185:2007 has been prepared as a particular standard based on IEC 60601-1, which gives general requirements for all aspects of safety, not only electrical safety, and many of the requirements are therefore applicable to humidifiers not powered by electricity. \nISO 8185:2007 is not applicable to devices commonly referred to as \"room humidifiers\" or humidifiers used in heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, or humidifiers incorporated into infant incubators.\nISO 8185:2007 is not applicable to nebulizers used for the delivery of drugs to patients.",

Medical practice is increasingly using medical electrical equipment and medical electrical systems for monitoring, treatment or diagnosis of patients in the emergency medical services environment. The safety of medical electrical equipment in this uncontrolled, rough environment is a cause for concern. This collateral standard was developed with contributions from clinicians, engineers and regulators. The terminology, requirements, general recommendations and guidance of this collateral standard are intended to be useful for manufacturers of medical electrical equipment and medical electrical systems and for technical committees responsible for the development of particular standards. This International Standard applies to the basic safety and essential performance of medical electrical equipment and medical electrical systems, hereafter referred to as ME equipment and ME systems, which are intended, as indicated in the instructions for  use by their manufacturer, for use in the EMS environment (Emergency Medical Services environment). The object of this collateral standard is to provide general requirements for ME equipment and ME \nsystems carried to the scene of an emergency and used there, as well as in transport, in situations where the ambient conditions differ from indoor conditions. The object of this collateral standard is to specify general requirements that are in addition to those of the general standard and to serve as the basis for particular standards.",

The home healthcare environment includes:                         - the dwelling place in which a patient lives;                \n- other places where patients are present both indoors and outdoors, excluding professional healthcare facility environments where operators with medical training are continually available when patients are present. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC 60601-1-11, published in 2010, and constitutes a technical revision. The most significant changes with respect to the previous edition include the following modifications:    \n- correction of test method for relative humidity control at temperatures above 35 \u00b0C;                                 \n- redrafting of subclauses that altered instead of adding to the general standard or other collateral standards; and       \n- harmonizing with the changes to the amendments to the general standard and other collateral standards.",

            "abstract": "ISO 3826-2:2008 addresses symbols that may be used to convey certain items of information related to medical devices dedicated to blood collection processes and storage. The information may be required on the device itself, as part of the label, or provided with the device. Many countries require that their own language be used to display textual information with medical devices. This raises problems to device manufacturers and users.\nThe symbols specified in ISO 3826-2:2008 do not replace current national regulatory requirements.\nManufacturers seek to take costs out of labelling by reducing or rationalizing variants. This results in a major problem of translation, design and logistics when multiple languages are included on a single label or piece of documentation. As other medical devices, blood medical devices, labelled in a number of different languages, can experience confusion and delay in locating the appropriate language. ISO 3826-2:2008 proposes solutions to these problems through the use of internationally recognized symbols with precisely defined meanings.\nISO 3826-2:2008 is primarily intended to be used by manufacturers of medical devices dedicated to the blood collection, process storage and distribution, who market identical products in countries having different language requirements for medical device labelling.\nISO 3826-2:2008 may also be of assistance to different stages of the blood supply chain, e.g.:\ndistributors of blood collection devices (manual or automated) or other representatives of manufacturers;\nblood centres and distribution centres to simplify and secure the operating procedures.\nThe use of these symbols is primarily intended for the medical device rather than the therapeutic product.",

Furthermore, there are requirements specifically applicable for zirconia-containing materials (see ISO 13356).\nIn the material composition as defined in this document, additional additives are listed. Typical additives for alumina or zirconia ceramics are Mg, Y, Ce and others. Such additives can be useful in order to improve the mechanical properties and/or the chemical stability of the alumina-zirconia composite material.\nThis document does not cover biocompatibility (see ISO 10993\u20111). It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to evaluate the biocompatibility of the specific ceramic composite material which is produced within the framework of this document.",

Guidance for the development of in vitro test methods is included in an informative annex to ISO 7198:2016. It can be considered as a supplement to ISO 14630:2012, which specifies general requirements for the performance of non-active surgical implants.\nNOTE          Due to the variations in the design of implants covered by ISO 7198 :2016 and, in some cases, due to the relatively recent development of some of these implants (e.g. bioabsorbable vascular prostheses, cell based tissue engineered vascular prostheses), acceptable standardized in vitro tests and clinical results are not always available. As further scientific and clinical data become available, appropriate revision of ISO 7198 :2016 will be necessary.\nIt is applicable to sterile tubular vascular grafts implanted by direct visualization surgical techniques as opposed to fluoroscopic or other non-direct imaging (e.g. computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), intended to replace, bypass, or form shunts between segments of the vascular system in humans and vascular patches intended for repair and reconstruction of the vascular system.\nVascular prostheses that are made of synthetic textile materials and synthetic non-textile materials are within the scope of ISO 7198:2016.\nWhile vascular prostheses that are made wholly or partly of materials of non-viable biological origin, including tissue engineered vascular prostheses are within the scope, ISO 7198:2016 does not address sourcing, harvesting, manufacturing and all testing requirements for biological materials. It is further noted that different regulatory requirements might exist for tissues from human and animal sources.\nCompound, coated, composite, and externally reinforced vascular prostheses are within the scope of ISO 7198:2016.\nEndovascular prostheses implanted using catheter delivery and non-direct visualization are excluded from the scope of ISO 7198:2016. It includes information on the development of appropriate test methods for graft materials, referenced in ISO 25539\u20111 for materials used in the construction of endovascular prostheses (i.e. stent-grafts).\nNOTE          Requirements for endovascular prostheses are specified in ISO 25539\u20111.\nThe valve component of valved conduits constructed with a tubular vascular graft component, and the combination of the valved component and the tubular vascular graft component, are excluded from the scope of ISO 7198:2016. It can be helpful in identifying the appropriate evaluation of the tubular vascular graft component of a valved conduit but specific requirements and testing are not described for these devices.\nCardiac and pericardial patches, vascular stents, accessory devices such as anastomotic devices, staplers, tunnelers and sutures, and pledgets are excluded from the scope of ISO 7198:2016.\nNOTE          Requirements for vascular stents are specified in ISO 25539\u20112.\nRequirements regarding cell seeding are excluded from the scope of ISO 7198:2016. Tissue engineered vascular prostheses that contain or are manufactured using cells present many distinct manufacturing (e.g. aseptic processing, cell seeding, etc.) and testing issues than those produced with synthetic or non-viable biological materials. The in vitro testing requirements that are outlined in ISO 7198:2016 can be a useful guide for certain testing requirements for these cell-based products.\nPharmacological aspects of drug-eluting or drug-coated vascular prostheses are not addressed in ISO 7198:2016.\nNOTE          Requirements for vascular device-drug combination products are specified in ISO 12417-1.\nDegradation, tissue ingrowth and/or tissue replacement, and other time-dependent aspects of absorbable vascular prostheses are not addressed in ISO 7198:2016.",

            "abstract": "ISO 12417-1:2015 specifies requirements for vascular device-drug combination products (VDDCPs) based upon current technical and medical knowledge. VDDCPs are medical devices with various clinical indications for use in the human vascular blood system. A VDDCP incorporates, as an integral part, substance(s) which, if used separately, can be considered to be a medicinal substance or product (drug substance, drug product) but the action of the medicinal substance is ancillary to that of the device and supports the primary mode of action (PMOA) of the device. With regard to safety, this part of ISO 12417 outlines requirements for intended performance, design attributes, materials, design evaluation, manufacturing, sterilization, packaging, and information supplied by the manufacturer. For implanted products, this International Standard should be considered as a supplement to ISO 14630, which specifies general requirements for the performance of non-active surgical implants. This International Standard should also be considered as a supplement to relevant device-specific standards, such as the ISO 25539\u2011series specifying requirements for endovascular devices. Requirements listed in this part of ISO 12417 also address VDDCPs that are not permanent implants.\nNOTE          Due to variations in the design of combination products covered by this part of ISO 12417 and due to the relatively recent development of some of these combination products, acceptable standardized in vitro test results and clinical study results are not always available. As further scientific and clinical data become available, appropriate revision of this part of ISO 12417 might be necessary.\nDelivery systems or parts of the delivery system are included in the scope of this part of ISO 12417, if they comprise an integral component of the vascular device and if they are drug-covered (e.g. drug-covered balloon catheters and drug-covered guidewires).\nDevices whose PMOA is to provide a conduit for delivery of a drug, are excluded from the scope of this part of ISO 12417 (e.g. infusion catheters), unless they contain a drug component that is intended to have an ancillary action to the device part (e.g. antimicrobial coated infusion catheter).\nProcedures and devices used prior to and following the introduction of the VDDCP (e.g. balloon angioplasty devices) are excluded from the scope of this part of ISO 12417 if they do not affect the drug-related aspects of the device.\nISO 12417-1:2015 is not comprehensive with respect to the pharmacological evaluation of VDDCPs. Some information on the requirements of different national and regional authorities is given in Annex B.\nAbsorbable components of VDDCPs (e.g. coatings) are addressed by this part of ISO 12417 in their connection with drug-related aspects of the device. Degradation and other time-dependent aspects of absorbable implants and coatings are not completely addressed by this part of ISO 12417.\nNOTE          See also ISO/TS 17137 and ASTM F3036-13.\nISO 12417-1:2015 does not address issues associated with viable or non-viable biological materials such as tissues, cells, or proteins.\nISO 12417-1:2015 does not address issues associated with active surgical implants (i.e. implants that require power not generated by the human body or gravity).",

In several instances in this International Standard, it became necessary to address the dialysis fluid, which is made by the end user, to help clarify the requirements for manufacturing concentrates. Because the manufacturer of the concentrate does not have control over the final dialysis fluid, any reference to dialysis fluid is for clarification and is not a requirement of the manufacturer.\nISO 13958:2009 includes concentrates in both liquid and powder forms. Also included are additives also called spikes, chemicals which may be added to the concentrate to increase the concentration of one or more of the existing ions in the concentrate and thus in the final dialysis fluid. This International Standard also gives requirements for equipment used to mix acid and bicarbonate powders into concentrate at the user's facility.",

This document does not address the specific evaluation of issues associated with viable tissues, viable cells, and/or implants with non-viable biological materials and their derivatives. Additionally, procedures and devices used prior to and following the introduction of the absorbable cardiovascular implant (e.g. balloon angioplasty devices) are excluded from the scope of this document if they do not affect the absorption aspects of the implant. A cardiovascular absorbable implant can incorporate substance(s) which, if used separately, can be considered to be a medicinal product (drug product) but the action of the medicinal substance is ancillary to that of the implant and supports the primary mode of action of the implant.\nNOTE\u00a01\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some aspects of absorbable components of cardiovascular device-drug combination products (e.g. coatings) in their connection with drug-related aspects of the device are addressed in ISO\u00a012417-1.\nNOTE\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An explanation of the nomenclature of absorb, degrade and related terms can be found in Annex\u00a0A.",

            "abstract": "ISO 17327-1:2018 specifies general requirements for implant coatings, comprising both surface coatings and surface modifications, applied to non-active surgical implants. This document specifies requirements concerned with generic coating properties including chemical and phase compositions, surface texture, coating coverage integrity, dissolvability, coating thickness, adhesion strength, abrasion resistance, porosity and pore size, and surface wettability.\nISO 17327-1:2018 is applicable to surface coatings, which are defined as layers of material with any different property than the natural surface of the substrate which are intentionally added to the substrate.\nISO 17327-1:2018 is applicable to surface modifications, which are defined as intentional conversion or reconstruction of the surface of the original substrate to form a new surface material consisting of components of the substrate's own material and possibly foreign material and forming a surface layer with different properties.\nSince the pertinent properties of a coating and their needed level of characterization are highly dependent on the intended application of the implant, the generic nature of the general requirements in this document is not intended to either override or replace the provisions of application-specific performance standards.\nISO 17327-1:2018 is not applicable to surfaces modified by texturing with the exclusive intention to change the roughness of the surface or the strength of the raw material.\nISO 17327-1:2018 is not applicable to natively passivated metal surfaces. While this document is applicable to intentionally passivated metal surfaces, well-established materials passivated by conventional techniques, such as nitric acid immersion, are usually non-hazardous and can be described in a very basic manner.\nISO 17327-1:2018 is not applicable to implant coatings utilizing viable tissue.\nISO 17327-1:2018 is not applicable to laminates, i.e. composite materials made of multiple layers, e.g. vascular prosthesis constructed of different expanded polytetrafluoroethylene layers, except the exposed surface of the laminate, which can be an implant coating (see 3.1, note 2 to entry).\nISO 17327-1:2018 is not applicable to coverings, e.g. covered stents.\nNOTE 1    ISO 17327-1:2018 does not contain requirements on biocompatibility. Nevertheless, this is a critical property of the device and coating and needs to be addressed during risk assessment.\nNOTE 2    ISO 17327-1:2018 supplements applicable non-active surgical implant standards and ISO 14630.\nNOTE 3    ISO 17327-1:2018 does not require that manufacturers have a quality management system in place. However, the application of a quality management system, such as that described in ISO 13485, could be appropriate to help ensure that the implant achieves its intended performance.\nNOTE 4    Although fully porous implants are not coatings, some of the considerations in this document can also be applied to them.",

This document does not specify exact test methods for functional and durability testing, but it offers requirements and recommendations for performance tests of the cardiac occluder system.\nSurgical occluders have been omitted from the scope of this document given their significant differences in device geometry, materials, implantation methods, and test methods as compared to transcatheter cardiac occluders.\nThis document is applicable to all intracardiac occluders intended for transcatheter implantation in humans (e.g. atrial septal occluder, ventricular septal occluder, patent foramen ovale occluder, left atrial appendage occluder, and paravalvular leak occluders). This document does not cover non-cardiac occluders, but elements of this document can be applicable to patent ductus arteriosus occluders.\nThe following devices and components are outside the scope of this document: surgical devices, cardiac shunt devices, atrial flow regulators, active components (such as sensors), or degradable or animal tissue components.\nThis document is applicable to both newly developed and modified cardiac occluders, their accessory devices, packaging, and labelling.\nThis document defines operational conditions and performance requirements for cardiac occluders where either adequate scientific or clinical evidence, or both, exists for their justification.\nNOTE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At the time of this document, it is impossible to take all future and emerging technologies into consideration. The cardiac occluder systems based on these new technologies can benefit from evaluation based on the basic requirements of this document.

Guidance for the development of in vitro test methods is included in an informative annex to this document. This document can be considered as a supplement to ISO 14630, which specifies general requirements for the performance of non-active surgical implants.\nISO 25539-1:2017 is applicable to endovascular systems used to treat aneurysms, stenoses or other vascular anomalies or pathologies (e.g. dissections, transections) or to create shunts between vessels [e.g. creation of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS)]. Some of the requirements are specific to endovascular treatment of arterial aneurysms or stenoses.

This document is supplemental to ISO 14630, which specifies general requirements for the performance of non-active surgical implants.\nNOTE 1  Due to the variations in the design of implants covered by this document, and in some cases due to the emergence of novel types of such implants, acceptable standardized in vitro tests and clinical results are not always available. As further scientific and clinical data become available, appropriate revision of this document will be necessary.\nThis document is applicable to vascular stents and vascular scaffolds (e.g. absorbable vascular scaffolds) used to treat vascular stenoses or other vascular abnormalities or pathologies. Some of the requirements are specific to endovascular treatment of arterial stenoses. Although uses of stent systems other than treatment of arterial stenoses (e.g. venous stenting) are within the scope of this document, comprehensive requirements and testing are not described for these uses.

Recommendations are given for beta-radiation source calibration, dosemetry measurements, dose calculation, dosemetric quality assurance, as well as for beta-radiation brachytherapy treatment planning. Guidance is also given for estimating the uncertainty of the absorbed dose to water. ISO 21439:2009 is applicable to \u201csealed\u201d radioactive sources, such as plane and concave surface sources, source trains of single seeds, line sources, shell and volume sources, for which only the beta radiation emitted is of therapeutic relevance.\nThe standardization of procedures in clinical dosemetry described in ISO 21439:2009 serves as a basis for the reliable application of beta-radiation brachytherapy. The specific dosemetric methods described in ISO 21439:2009 apply to sources for the curative treatment of ophthalmic disease, for intravascular brachytherapy treatment, for overcoming the problem of restenosis and for other clinical applications using beta radiation.\nISO 21439:2009 is geared towards organizations wishing to establish reference methods in dosemetry aiming at clinical demands for an appropriately small uncertainty of the delivered dose. ISO 21439:2009 does not exclude the possibility that there can be other methods leading to the same or smaller measurement uncertainties.",

Twenty-five focimeters of different types were used. The test lenses were spherically powered allyl diglycol carbonate (ADC) hard resin lenses surfaced to -4,00 D, -2,00 D, 0,00 D, +2,00 D, and +4,00 D, each with an addition power of 2,50 D. Five were D28 bifocals and five were progressive power lenses. The measurements were front distance power, front near power, back distance power and back near power, for each lens and for each focimeter used. Each lens was measured nine times: five measurements taken without repositioning the lens and four measurements taken with the lens repositioned each time.\nThe assessed parameters were divided in three categories:\ndiscrepancies due to focimeter design and measurement methods;systematic errors;random errors.\nFor each parameter, experimental results are given, as well as theoretical ones when needed. Measurement data include front distance portion power, front near portion power, back distance portion power and back near portion power.\nUnless stated otherwise, in order to show relevant information, the results shown are for the D28 bifocals when no different behaviour was found for the progressive power lenses.",

This three-digit number forms the second group of three (two plus one) digits in the 15-digit overall number.\nSeveral examples of complete 15-digit identification numbers are given to demonstrate the number coding system, including examples of three (additional) optional digits (16 to 18) for diamond instruments.\nIn addition to terms for rotary instuments and accessories used in two of the three official ISO languages (English, French and Russian), ISO 6360-1:2004 gives the equivalent terms in the German language; these are published under the responsibility of the member body for Germany (DIN).

The MIC reflects the activity of the drug under the described test conditions and can be interpreted for clinical management purposes by taking into account other factors, such as drug pharmacology or antifungal resistance mechanisms. In addition, MIC distributions can be used to define wild type or non-wild type fungal populations. Clinical interpretation of the MIC value is beyond the scope of this document; interpretive category breakpoints specific to the CLSI- and EUCAST-derived methods can be found by consulting the latest interpretive tables provided by the organizations[5][15].

This also includes IVD MDs where results are categorized among ordinal categories based on pre-established quantitative intervals for a quantity.\nc)   RMs intended for use as trueness control materials for verification or assessment of calibration of IVD MDs, i.e. some commutable CRMs and some external quality assessment (EQA) materials (if so indicated in the RM's intended use statement).\nd)   IVD MD-specific calibrators and trueness control materials with assigned values, intended to be used together with a specified IVD MD.\ne)   IVD MDs as described in a) and b), where no end-user performed calibration is required (i.e. when the manufacturer performs a factory calibration of the IVD MD).\nThis document is not applicable to:\na)   calibrators and trueness control materials for IVD MDs which, due to their formulation, are known to have zero amount of measurand;\nb)   control materials that are used only for internal quality control purposes in medical laboratories to assess the imprecision of an IVD MD, either its repeatability or reproducibility, and/or for assessing changes in IVD MD results compared to a previously established calibration condition;\nc)   control materials that are used only for internal quality control purposes in medical laboratories and which are supplied with intervals of suggested acceptable values that are not metrologically traceable to higher order reference system components;\nd)   properties reported as nominal scales and ordinal scales, where no magnitude is involved.\nNOTE 2  Nominal scales are typically used to report e.g. identity of blood cell types, microorganism types, identity of nucleic acid sequences, identity of urine particles.\nNOTE 3  Ordinal scales are often applied to results differentiated into dichotomous groupings (e.g. ?sick' vs. ?healthy'), and occasionally to results differentiated into non-dichotomous categories where the result categories are rank-ordered but the rank-ordered categories cannot be differentiated in terms of relative degree of difference, e.g. negative, +1, +2, +3 for grading of presence of haemoglobin in urine specimens by visual observation.",

Whilst recognizing that some people with very extensive and complex disabilities may have requirements beyond the level addressed in this Guide, a very large number of people have minor impairments which can be easily addressed by relatively small changes of approach in standards, thereby increasing the market for the product or service.\nThis Guide aims\nto inform, increase understanding and raise awareness about how human abilities impact on the usability of products, services and environments,to outline the relationship between the requirements in standards and the accessibility and usability of products and services, andto raise awareness about the benefits of adopting accessible design principles in terms of a wider market.\n1.2 This Guide applies to products, services and environments encountered in all aspects of daily life and intended for the consumer market and the workplace. For the purposes of this document, the term 'products and services' is used to reflect all these purposes.\n1.3 This Guide\ndescribes a process by which the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities may be considered in the development of standards,provides tables to enable standards developers to relate the relevant clauses of a standard to the factors which should be considered to ensure that all abilities are addressed,offers descriptions of body functions or human abilities and the practical implications of impairment,offers a list of sources that standards developers can use to investigate more detailed and specific guidance materials.\n1.4 This Guide provides general guidance. Consideration should be given to the development of additional guides for specific product or service sectors.\n1.5 While it is recognized that accessibility and usability are important for both products amd services, international work on services standards is at the preliminary stage. At present, this Guide contains considerably more guidance on products than on services.\n1.6 This Guide is also available as a Braille version. Copies may be obtained through the ISO Central Secretariat.",

This can include recline, tilt, elevate and stand-up mechanisms or a combination of these. In order for a wheelchair to be able to recline, tilt, elevate and/or stand-up, the wheelchair requires additional mechanisms and mechanical structures to allow these features to operate. This document specifies the different functional and strength tests required to test these wheelchairs in critical configurations of their adjustable range.\nThis document does not cover wheelchairs where the only operator adjustable body support system (OABSS) is adjustable limb or head postural support devices alone (e.g. elevating leg supports).\nThis document does not include wheelchair and postural support device customization during initial or subsequent setup of a wheelchair for an individual occupant. It also does not reflect other factors that can influence wheelchair stability such as occupant movement, cushion thickness, and the addition of ancillary equipment (e.g. respiratory support items).",

The provision of hearing aids relies on the knowledge and practices of a hearing aid professional, to ensure the proper fitting and adequate service in the interest of the client with hearing loss.\nThis document specifies general processes of HAFM from the client profile to the follow-up through administering, organising and controlling hearing aid fitting through all stages. It also specifies important preconditions such as education, facilities and systems that are required to ensure proper services.\nThe focus of this document is the services offered to the majority of adult clients with hearing impairment. It is recognized that certain populations with hearing loss such as children, persons with other disabilities or persons with implantable devices can require services outside the scope of this document. This document generally applies to air conduction hearing aids and for the most part also to bone conduction devices.\nHearing loss can be a consequence of serious medical conditions. Hearing aid professionals are not in a position to diagnose or treat such conditions. When assisting clients seeking hearing rehabilitation without prior medical examination, hearing aid professionals are expected to be observant of symptoms of such conditions and refer to proper medical care.\nFurther to the main body of the document, which specifies the HAFM requirements and processes, several informative annexes are provided. Appropriate education of hearing aid professionals is vital for exercising HAFM. Annex A defines the competencies required for the HAFM processes. Annex B offers a recommended curriculum for the education of hearing aid professionals. Annex C is an example of an appropriate fitting room. Annex D gives guidance on the referral of clients for medical or other specialist examination and treatment. Annex E is a recommendation for important information to be exchanged with the client during the process of HAFM. Annex F is a comprehensive terminology list offering definitions of the most current terms related to HAFM.\nIt is the intention that these annexes be helpful to those who wish to deliver HAFM of the highest quality.",
